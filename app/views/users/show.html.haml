        Please log all the trips you take   
        during the drive less challenge,       
        including driving alone.  This will    
        help us all understand the role of     
        green travel compared to solo driving. 
        If you used more than one travel mode  
        on a trip, enter the car, bike, bus,   
        etc parts into separate trip entries   
        to give an accurate count for the green
        miles and CO2 emissions avoided.
